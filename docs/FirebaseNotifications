## Firebase Notifications

Message types

With FCM, you can send two types of messages to clients:

Notification messages - Delivered when the application is in background. These messages trigger the onMessageReceived() callback only when your app is in foreground

Data messages - Handled by the client app. Theses messages trigger the onMessageReceived() callback even if your app is in foreground/background/killed
